JSON JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is **a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax**
. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications

lightweight format for storing and transporting data

JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page

JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

- its string with a specified data format — it contains only properties, no method

it supports the following two data structures −

- **Collection of name/value pairs** − This Data Structure is supported by different programming languages.
- **Ordered list of values** − It includes array, list, vector or sequence etc.
- Creation of an empty Object −
- 

```jsx

var JSONObj = {};

```

```jsx
Creation of a new Object −
```

```jsx
var JSONObj = new Object();

```

```jsx
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Creating Object JSON with JavaScript</title>
      <script language = "javascript" >
         var JSONObj = { "name" : "tutorialspoint.com", "year"  : 2005 };

         document.write("<h1>JSON with JavaScript example</h1>");
         document.write("<br>");
         document.write("<h3>Website Name = "+JSONObj.name+"</h3>");
         document.write("<h3>Year = "+JSONObj.year+"</h3>");
      </script>
   </head>

   <body>
   </body>
</html>

```

**document object model**

The **Document Object Model**
 (**DOM**)- 

connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can interact with the page.

 **DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a different format with the use of objects**

DOM can be thought of as a Tree or Forest(more than one tree). The term **structure model** 
is sometimes used to describe the tree-like representation of a document.  Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects  Event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered on an occurrence of a given event.

```jsx
[<table>
  <ROWS>
    <tr>
      <td>Car</td>
      <td>Scooter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>MotorBike</td>
      <td>Bus</td>
    </tr>
  </ROWS>
</table

```

- E**vent**

events **contain the input your lambda function will get in json format**
. Regardless of how a lambda is triggered, it will always have 2 fixed parameters: Event and Context. Context contains additional information about the trigger like source, while Event Contains any input parameters that your lambda needs to run

```jsx
{
  "firstname": "Tom",
  "lastname": "Cruise",
  "occupation": "Actor"
}

```

In JavaScript, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as a user clicking a button or a page finishing loading. JavaScript code can be used to listen for these events and trigger certain actions when they occur. Some common DOM events include "click", "submit", "load", and "resize". In Node.js, events are used extensively throughout the platform to handle asynchronous operations. The built-in "events" module provides a way to create, emit, and listen for custom events in Node.js.

In JSON, an event can be represented as a JSON object with properties that describe the event. For example:

```jsx
{
  "eventType": "click",
  "target": "button",
  "timestamp": "2021-07-22T10:30:00Z"
}

```

This object represents a "click" event that occurred on a "button" element at the timestamp "2021-07-22T10:30:00Z".

- **Event Listeners**

Event Listeners is a method in JavaScript which waits for an event to take place. Event Listeners, also known as Event Handlers, where we can assign event listeners to particular events on a particular element. Event Listener is an interface representing an object that handles events dispatched by Event Object. Events are an important part of JavaScript as web pages respond based on the events.

```jsx
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>JavaScript Event Listener</h2>
<h3>This event will show 'click' event of a button</h3>
<button id="btn">Click Here!</button>
<script>
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function() {
document.write("<p>Hi this is the click event listener in JavaScript</p>");
});
</script>
</body>
</html>

```

**storage**

there is two types of storage -**Local Storage, session Storage**

The main features of local storage are:

- Shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin.
- The data does not expire. It remains after the browser restart and even OS reboot.

```jsx
// set key
localStorage.test = 2;

// get key
alert( localStorage.test ); // 2

// remove key
delete localStorage.test;

```

**session storage**

The session storage object is used much less often than session storage

Properties and methods are the same, but it’s much more limited:

- The session storage exists only within the current browser tab.
    - Another tab with the same page will have a different storage.
    - But it is shared between iframes in the same tab (assuming they come from the same origin).
- The data survives page refresh, but not closing/opening the tab.

Let’s see that in action.

Run this code…

```jsx
sessionStorage.setItem('test', 1);

```

…Then refresh the page. Now you can still get the data:

```jsx
alert( sessionStorage.getItem('test') ); // after refresh: 1

```

…But if you open the same page in another tab, and try again there, the code above returns null, meaning “nothing found”.

That’s exactly because session storage  is bound not only to the origin, but also to the browser tab. For that reason, session storage  is used sparingly.

Web storage objects local storage and session storage allow to store key/value pairs in the browser.

- Both key and value must be strings.
- The limit is 5mb+, depends on the browser.
- They do not expire.
- The data is bound to the origin (domain/port/protocol).

- **local Storage**

Shared between all tabs and windows with the same origin

Survives browser restart

- **session Storage**

Visible within a browser tab, including iframes from the same origin

Survives page refresh (but not tab close)

Here is an example of how to set a key in local storage using JavaScript:

```jsx
// set key
localStorage.test = 2;

```

Here is an example of how to get a key from local storage:

```jsx
// get key
alert( localStorage.test ); // 2

```

Here is an example of how to remove a key from local storage:

```jsx
// remove key
delete localStorage.test;

```

Remember that both the key and the value must be strings, and the data will remain in local storage even after the browser is restarted.

Here is an example of how to set a key in session storage using JavaScript:

```jsx
// set key
sessionStorage.setItem('test', 1);

```

- *Here is an example of how to get a key from session storage:

```jsx
// get key
alert( sessionStorage.getItem('test') ); // 1

```

Here is an example of how to remove a key from session storage:

```jsx
// remove key
sessionStorage.removeItem('test');

```

Remember that both the key and the value must be strings, and the data will remain in session storage even after the page is refreshed. However, it will be cleared when the tab is closed or the browser is restarted.

- **DOM**

A an acronym that stands for Document Object Model. It’s how a web browser represents a web page internally.

The DOM determines what content should be on a page and how each element of the content relates to the other elements

- D**ocument**

 A is away to structure information, including articles, books, and scientific papers. For Web Developers, a document is a name for a web page, and they consider the DOM as a model for all the stuff on the web page

 

- **object**

The “stuff” on web pages are objects and are sometimes called elements or nodes

- **model**

 A representation of something, and it helps us understand how something is put together. There are models for many things that need to be universally understood, analyzed, and used.

The DOM is represented as a type of data structure called a tree. Every object in the DOM is hierarchically under another object, and any object can have multiple children but only one parent.

Each DOM object “owns” its children. If you remove an object from the DOM, all of its children will also be removed with it.

- T**ree graph**

One way to represent the DOM is with a tree graph. A tree graph shows the relationship between parent and child objects, with lines between them representing their relationship.

Take a family tree as an example. At the top, you’d have your grandparents. Then, below, you’d have your parents and their siblings, followed by you, your siblings, and your cousins.

- **HTML**

The most common way to represent the DOM is with [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=ccblog&utm_content=cw_what_is_dom_blog)
. You can take a look at the HTML of a web page HTML elements wrap other elements that are its children. The img element is a child of the header element, which is a child of the body element, which is a child of the HTML element.

- S**ource Code**

There are more ways to create a document than using HTML. You can use a back-end programming language like [PHP](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/php?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=ccblog&utm_content=cw_what_is_dom_blog) to generate HTML when a web page is loaded. You can use [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/javascript?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=ccblog&utm_content=cw_what_is_dom_blog) to modify elements in the web page dynamically. Or, you can use a front-end framework like [React](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=ccblog&utm_content=cw_what_is_dom_blog) to create complete web pages without writing any HTML.

## HTML DOM is a standard **object** model and **programming interface** for HTML. It defines:

- The HTML elements as **objects**
- The **properties** of all HTML elements
- The **methods** to access all HTML elements
- The **events** for all HTML elements

In other words:

 

- **The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.**

**promise and call back**

Promises provide a more succinct and clear way of representing sequential asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are effectively a different syntax for achieving the same effect as callbacks. The advantage is increased readability

```jsx
aAsync()
  .then(bAsync)
  .then(cAsync)
  .done(finish);

```

JavaScript runs code sequentially in top-down order. However, there are some cases that code runs (or must run) after something else happens and also not sequentially. This is called asynchronous programming.

- P**romise**

Promises allow us to wait on certain code to finish execution prior to running the next bit of code.

- D**ifference with call back**

The **difference** between the two is when using the callback approach, we’d normally just pass a callback into a function that would then get called upon completion in order to get the result of something. In Promises, however, you attach callbacks on the returned Promise object.

- **Callback**
1. It was getting harder to read (The code was beginning to move in two directions — top to bottom, then left to right).
2. It was getting harder to manage.
3. It wasn’t clear what was happening as the code was being nested deeper.
4. We would always have to make sure we didn’t accidentally declare variables with the same names that were already declared in the outer scopes
5. We had to account for three different errors at three different locations.

```jsx
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve) => {
resolve([‘apple’, ‘orange’]);
});
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => {
resolve([‘grape’, ‘banana’]);
});
let fruitsArray = [];
Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
.then(([basket1, basket2]) => {
basket1.forEach((fruit) => {
fruitsArray.push(fruit);
});
basket2.forEach((fruit) => {
fruitsArray.push(fruit);
});
console.log(fruitsArray);
}).catch((error) => { console.log(error) });

```
